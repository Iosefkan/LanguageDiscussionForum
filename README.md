This website was made as a uni project. It is a language forum with C# ASP.NET Core on the backend and Svelte + Vite on the frontend, styled with tailwind and typechecked (where was possible) with typescript.
Note that in order for the app to function properly appsettings.json in server folder needs to be updated with your email and mysql connection string.
